## Files Created
- `miles_ai_enhanced_system.py` - Enhanced system with advanced features
- `miles_1000_tweets_fetcher.py` - Bulk tweet fetcher and analyzer
- `miles_ai_qa_performance.py` - QA and performance testing suite
- `miles_ai_production_deploy.py` - Production deployment automation
- `miles_1000_enhanced.jsonl` - Enhanced training dataset
- `model_improvements.json` - ML optimization parameters
- `start_miles_ai_production.bat` - Production launcher

## Continuous Learning
The system automatically:
- Fetches new tweets every 20-30 minutes
- Updates training data with high-quality examples
- Adjusts generation parameters based on engagement
- Logs all learning events for monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Monitor system performance via dashboard
2. Review generation quality and adjust if needed
3. Check logs in `logs/` directory for any issues
4. Consider implementing authentication for production use
5. Set up SSL/TLS for secure communications

## Testing
Test the system with various inputs:
```python
# Quick test
python test_production.py

# Manual test
curl http://localhost:8000/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":"bitcoin halving impact"}'
```

## Maintenance
- Logs rotate daily in `logs/` directory
- Training data backed up in `backups/`
- Metrics stored in `monitoring/`
- Configuration files in root directory
