1. Macro tailwind (liquidity injection)

Real alt-season requires macro liquidity + a narrative strong enough to steamroll bagholders.

Missing either = underwhelming pumps. https://t.co/aB4cD5eF6g""",

    """Alt-season math is simple:

Liquidity + New Narrative > Legacy Bags = Moon
Liquidity + No Narrative = Choppy pump

Plan accordingly. https://t.co/hJ7kM8nP9q""",

Overhang creating resistance but breakout intact.

Alt-season catalyst checklist:
- Macro liquidity
- Narrative > bagholders

Both required or expect chop.""",

    """Everyone waiting for alt-season.

It needs:
- Macro liquidity (rate cuts, ETF hype)
- Narrative that dwarfs old bags

Without both? Just choppy pumps.
