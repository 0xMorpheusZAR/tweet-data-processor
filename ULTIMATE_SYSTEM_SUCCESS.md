- **Training Data: 994 tweets** analyzed from @milesdeutscher
- **Cache System: Active** with smart memory caching
- **Architecture: Clean** with SOLID principles

### Example Output:
**Input:** "overhang and alt-season catalysts"

**Generated Tweet:**
```
The overhang and alt-season catalysts narrative is exhausting.

What matters: positioning for what's next.

Until then? We're all just trading chop.
